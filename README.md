# Docker Community

Welcome to the Docker Community repo! This repo aims to centralize content (HOW-TOs, scripts, slides, etc) curated by the Docker Team for the Docker Community. 

The main objective is to help members of the Docker community who share similar interests to learn from & collaborate with each other during Docker Meetups. 

#### [Official Docker Tutorials] (https://github.com/docker/labs)
This repo contains official Docker tutorials authored both by Docker, Inc and by members of the community. It's a growing repo which we intend to continue to grow, with help from the community.

Anyone can start a Docker Meetup as long as they comply with our Code of Conduct. [This guide] (https://www.docker.com/starting-docker-meetup-group) documents the best practices to launch a Docker Meetup group and keep it active with some tips on overcoming challenges associated with leading a meetup group. There are no silver bullets when organizing events for your local community.
