# #SwarmWeek

[#SwarmWeek is coming on March 7-11! Check this blog post for more info] (https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/swarmweek-is-coming/)
- Share your Docker Swarm story! 
How do you use Docker Swarm? Are you using Docker Swarm in production? Let us know!
We’re raffling off tickets to DockerCon 2016 in exchange for user stories. Write a blog post or share a screenshot or video of your UCP dashboard or Swarm cluster and tweet with the hashtag #SwarmWeek and we’ll enter you into a drawing for a free ticket.
- Have a Swarm question?
Now is a great time to ask all of your questions about Docker Swarm. Feel free to post your questions on twitter with the hashtag [#swarmweek] (https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23swarmweek&src=typd) . We’ll answer them on this blog and also share those answers during the Q&A with the Docker Swarm team on Monday.
