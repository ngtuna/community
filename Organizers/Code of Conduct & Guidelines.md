#Welcome to the Docker Organizer program! 
 
Docker meetups bring together people who are interested in, use, develop, and support the Docker ecosystem. Whether you are just starting out, or have been organizing meetups for the past few years, we really appreciate your commitment and are very grateful for your contributions to the Docker Community. 
 
By holding the organizer or co-organizer leadership position, you are participating in this program and shall agree to abide by the following Code of Conduct. This is to ensure that Docker meetup organizers are a respected and professional group demonstrating a positive impact in the Docker ecosystem. 
 
The Code of Conduct is not a comprehensive list of do’s and don’ts, but rather a living set of guidelines to follow that we will continue to refine as the program matures. Our goal is to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could negatively impact members of the community, not restrict the diversity of ideas and expression.
 
You are responsible for keeping abreast of changes to this document. If you need further clarification or are unable to fulfill any of the following guidelines, please let us know at your earliest convenience. 

# Embody the Docker Community Code of Conduct

All Docker community members should strive to follow our community guidelines. As a Docker organizer, it is especially important to lead by showing model behavior at all times, both in person and online.  

# Understand Docker beyond containers. 

As meetup organizers, you understand that Docker is a technology stack and [Container as a Service (Caas) Platform] (https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/) . Ideally, you have a good understanding of all the pieces (Engine, Swarm, Machine, Compose, etc.) and how they fit together. You may feature Docker ecosystem tools at the local meetups your organize but you are still enthusiastic about Docker as a whole technology and platform.

#Be a force for good in the community
	
- Promote and support inclusivity, respect, and professionalism in the tech community.  
- Strive to keep the group active with frequent meetups and presentations on relevant content (including the latest Docker releases and cool projects using Docker products). If you can no longer commit to being an organizer, struggle to find good speakers or sponsors, please give us a heads up so that we can help out. 
- Ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a safe and welcoming environment that encourages mutual respect and collaboration.
- Keep up-to-date on the latest technological advances in Docker and the ecosystem. 
- Collaborate with the Docker Community team to support the organization of Docker-centric meetups and local editions of global meetup campaigns (Docker Birthday, Global Hack Day, etc) in your local community. 

#Curate balanced and accurate content

- When selecting the content of the meetups and/or using program resources to produce content, prioritize featuring Docker-native solutions over others. 
- Be respectful when mentioning other vendors, technologies, and communities in the ecosystem.
- Select content that is educational, accurate, and free from sales pitches. 
- Do not accept talks which slander or publish libel against Docker or other people and companies.
- Be rigorous in assessing the content submitted by potential speakers. If you need help validating results and analyses, reach out for assistance. 
- If you experience difficulties with Docker products or programs, give us the opportunity to address your feedback in advance. 

#Enforcing this Code of Conduct
Docker reserves the right to remove any member from the Organizer program for violating this Code of Conduct. In the event of a violation, the Docker community team will review the situation and determine the consequences on a case by case basis. When an organizer is removed from the program, we retire the remaining benefits and his or her access to Docker Organizer resources.
